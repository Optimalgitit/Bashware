# Bashware
A script you put in your .bashrc to extend the possibilities of bash.
# Installation instructions
## Step One
Copy everything in the script at once,
## Step Two
Paste everything at the very end of your .bashrc
### Step Three
Restart your terminal/bash session

Done!

# Upgrade Instructions
## Step One
Remove everything that you pasted while installing. If you don't know where to delete from, you should look for a comment I made. Erase everything below it.
## Step Two
Do the install instructions.
### Step Three (Optional)
If you want to keep the config you had, do not erase the config section. Then, once Bashware is upgraded, you should see a newer config section. Keep your original one, and erase the new one.

Done!
